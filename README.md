# VBA-Table-Creator

One of my jobs in actuary was to create a vba application that moved all the data from our rate indications reports (pivot tables (using slicers)) into a usefull summarized view.  I created this object like application to do this in a simple way.  The code can be customized to however you want it or need it.
